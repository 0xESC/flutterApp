# flutterApp
Basically, startup_namer App is a simple mobile app that generates proposed names for a startup company. The user can select and unselect names, saving the best ones. The code lazily generates ten names at a time. As the user scrolls, new batches of names are generated. The user can scroll forever, with new names being continually generated.
